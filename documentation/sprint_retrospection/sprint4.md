# Sprint 4 Retrospective
The method chosen for assigning values to user stories is the Fibonacci Sequence.
### 1. Stories for sprint 4
| User stories                                                                                                                                               | Value | Completed |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|
| As a user, the people whom I shared my itineraries with are able to edit the itinerary, so that we can plan the trip as a group                               | 13     |     - [x] .      |
| As a user, I want to be able to edit my itineraries, so that I can make changes when I feel like it.                                                            | 8     |     - [x] .       |
| As a user, I want to see the visuals of my itineraries on a map, so that I can have a picture of the routes I am going to take for my trip. | 13     |   - [x] .         |
| As a user I want to be able to delete my itineraries, so that I can get rid of itineraries that I am no longer interested in.                                                | 8     |      - [x] .      |
| As a user, I want to be able to share my itinerary privately with other users so that they can see the shared itinerary.                                                            | 5     |     - [x] .       |

|**Total Value**|**55**|
            
# **The velocity for Sprint 4: 55 - 0 = 55** 
# **The overall velocity is (39 + 47 + 37 + 55)/4 = 44.5**
