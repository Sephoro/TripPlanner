# Sprint 5 Retrospective
The method chosen for assigning values to user stories is the Fibonacci Sequence.
### 1. Stories for sprint 5
| User stories                                                                                                                                               | Value | Completed |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|
|As a user, I want to be able to see my name on the navbar so that I can be certain that I logged in with my credentials                               | 5     |     - [x] .      |

| As a user, I want to be able to search for hotels so that I can make a decision on which hotel will be best suitable for my stay in a specific city if I need one. | 8     |   - [x] .         |
| As a user I want to have my own logged in session, so that my session doesn't clash with sessions of other users.                                                | 8     |      - [x] .     |

|**Total Value**|**47**|
            
# **The velocity for Sprint 5: 47-0= 47** 
# **The overall velocity is (39 + 47 + 37 + 55 + 47)/5 = 45**

|   Taking full advantage of dependecy Injection to ensure code flexibility and ease of testing|Making commits with lines of codes which are commented out. Lines of codes which are commented out shoud be deleted| In future projects, contiunue testing each function in program files. |
